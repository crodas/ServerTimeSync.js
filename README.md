ServerTimeSync.js
=================

Use the server time at the client side.

How does it work?
-----------------

Include the `sync.js` into your html, and setup the `timeURL` to the time server.

```html
<script>
var timeURL = "http://time.server.com/";
 (function(w,s){
    var f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
      j = d.createElement(s),
    j.async = true;
    j.src = '/sync.js';
    f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
  })(window,document,'script');
</script>
```

The time server is a very lightweight server, capable of handling thousands of requests per second, and returns a json with time.

The script `sync.js` will override `Date` class, and it will contain the server time; to use the client time you must use `LocalDate` class.

The time synchronization is asynchronous and the first time could take a few seconds, but we store the offset in localStorage to avoid resynchronizing for the next hour.

```html
<script>
var timeURL = "http://37.153.159.15:9999";
var timeSynced = false;
var retry = setInterval(function() {
    if (timeSynced) {
        clearInterval(retry);
        alert("Time is sinced, there is " + (Date.now() - LocalDate.now()) + "ms of difference");
    }
}, 100);
</script>
<script src="sync.js"></script>
```

Server
------

The server is very simple, it is written in NodeJS. I'll push a C server which performs much better.
